        <p>A health department is a government agency, operating at local, state, or national levels, tasked with protecting and promoting the health of the general public. Acting as the foundation for public health, these departments focus on preventing disease, managing health policies, and ensuring environmental safety. Their core functions include monitoring community health status, investigating health hazards, enforcing safety regulations, and providing essential services such as immunizations and maternal care. By addressing both communicable and noncommunicable disease risks, health departments work to improve overall population well-being, often acting as a safety net for vulnerable, uninsured, or underserved populations</p>
